Just see a video that teachs you how to learn any language in six months on youtube. It's created by Chris Lonsdale. I think it's very interesting and I believe those ways will be useful for us. So that's why I note it.

### The Big Question
- How can normal adults learn a `NEW LANGUAGE` **Quickly**, **Easily**, **Effectively**?

### How
- There have **`5 Principles`** and **`7 Actions`**.    
- The two things that really don't matter:
  - <del>Talent</del>
  - <del>Immersion per se</del>

### 5 Principles of Rapid Language Acquisition
There have four words you need to keep in your mind: **Meaning**, **Relevance**, **Attention**, **Memory**

#### Principle #1:
**`Focus` on language content that is `relevant` to you.**

#### Principle #2:
**User your `New Language` as a `Tool` to `Communicate` ... from Day 1**

#### Principle #3:
**When you first `UNDERSTAND` the `MESSAGE`, you will unconsciously `ACQUIRE` the Language**

*Note:* **Language learning is NOT ABOUT KNOWLEGE..., It's about `Physiological Training`**

#### Principle #4:
**Language learning is about `Physiological Training`**   
- *Talking takes muscle... when your `FACE HURTS`, you are doing it `RIGHT`*

#### Principle #5:
**Psycho-Physiological `STATE Matters`**   
- *Very important idea... You Must Learn to Tolerate Ambiguity*


### 7 Actions for Rapid Language Acquisition
#### Action #1:
**`Listen A LOT!`**   
- *Brain Soaking with New Language*

#### Action #2:
**Focus on getting the meaning `FIRST` (before the words)**   
- *Use Body Language*   
- *Use Patterns You Already Know*

#### Action #3:
**Start Mixing!**   
- *So... get creative... start mixing!*

##### Week 1 (The Tool Box)   
-What is this?   
-How do you say?   
-I don't understand...     
*All in the TARGET LANGUAGE*
 
##### Week 2-3 (Pronouns, Common Verbs, Adjectives)
-you   
-that   
-me    
-give   
-hot   
-...

##### Week 4 (Glue Words)
-But   
-And   
-Even though   
-...   

 
#### Action #5
**Get a Language Parent**         
Language Parent "Rules":        
- Works to understand what you are saying   
- Does not correct mistake   
- Confirms understanding by using correct language   
- Uses words the learner knows   

#### Action #6
**Copy the `Face`**

#### Action #7
**`Direct Connect` to Mental Images**
