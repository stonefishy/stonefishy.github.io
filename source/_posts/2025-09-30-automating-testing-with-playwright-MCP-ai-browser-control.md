Automation testing has evolved significantly with the introduction of AI-powered tools. Today, we can leverage the power of `Playwright` framework combined with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create intelligent testing workflows that understand natural language test scenarios and execute them automatically. In this blog, we'll explore how to use Playwright MCP with AI assistants like GitHub Copilot to streamline your testing process.

## Introduction to Playwright Framework

{% image /assets/images/ai-ml/playwright.png, alt="Playwright" %}

Playwright is a modern, cross-browser automation framework developed by Microsoft that has revolutionized web application testing. It provides a robust and reliable solution for end-to-end testing, offering several key advantages over traditional testing frameworks.

### Key Features of Playwright

**Cross-Browser Support**: Playwright supports all modern browsers including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, allowing you to test your applications across different browser engines with a single API.

**Multi-Language Support**: While originally built for Node.js, Playwright now supports multiple programming languages including Python, Java, and .NET, making it accessible to diverse development teams.

**Auto-Wait Capabilities**: One of Playwright's most powerful features is its intelligent auto-wait mechanism. It automatically waits for elements to be ready before performing actions, eliminating the need for manual sleep statements and reducing flaky tests.

**Modern Web Features**: Playwright handles modern web application patterns seamlessly, including:
- Single Page Applications (SPAs)
- Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
- Shadow DOM elements
- iframes and pop-ups
- File downloads and uploads

**Network Intercession**: Advanced network interception capabilities allow you to mock API responses, monitor network traffic, and simulate various network conditions.

**Mobile Testing**: Built-in support for mobile browser testing with device emulation, touch gestures, and geolocation simulation.

### Architecture and Design

Playwright uses a unique architecture that connects directly to browser instances through debugging protocols, providing:
- **Fast Execution**: Direct browser communication eliminates overhead
- **Reliable Element Selection**: Multiple selector strategies including text, CSS, XPath, and accessibility selectors
- **Parallel Execution**: Native support for parallel test execution across browsers and devices
- **Headless and Headed Modes**: Flexibility to run tests with or without browser UI

## Introducing Playwright MCP

`Model Context Protocol (MCP)` represents a breakthrough in AI-tool integration, enabling AI assistants to interact with external tools and services seamlessly. The Playwright MCP brings this capability to web automation testing, allowing AI models to understand testing requirements in natural language and execute them using Playwright's powerful automation capabilities.

### What is Playwright MCP?

`Playwright MCP` is an implementation of the Model Context Protocol that exposes Playwright's functionality to AI assistants. It acts as a bridge between natural language testing instructions and Playwright's programmatic API, enabling:

- **Natural Language Test Execution**: Describe test scenarios in plain English
- **Intelligent Element Detection**: AI-powered element identification and interaction
- **Dynamic Test Generation**: Automatic test case creation based on requirements
- **Real-time Test Execution**: Execute tests and get immediate feedback
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Run tests across multiple browsers simultaneously

### Architecture Overview

The Playwright MCP consists of several key components:

```
AI Assistant (VS Code Github Copilot/Goose) ‚Üê‚Üí MCP Client ‚Üê‚Üí Playwright MCP Server ‚Üê‚Üí Browser Instances
```

- **MCP Client**: Handles communication between AI assistant and MCP server
- **Playwright MCP Server**: Translates AI requests into Playwright commands
- **Browser Management**: Manages browser instances and test execution
- **Result Processing**: Formats and returns test results to the AI assistant

### Configuration in VS Code GitHub Copilot

To configure Playwright MCP with VS Code GitHub Copilot, you need to set up the MCP server in your `mcp.json` configuration file:

```json
{
    "playwright": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
            "@playwright/mcp@latest"
        ]
    },
}
```

## Demo: Automated Testing with AI and Playwright MCP

Let's demonstrate the power of Playwright MCP by executing real test scenarios using natural language instructions. We'll test the JBL Fit Checker website with two comprehensive test cases. You also can see the playwright auto open the browser window to execute the test cases.

### Test Case 1: Landing Page Content Verification

**Test Scenario**: Verify that the JBL Fit Checker landing page contains the expected branding text.

**Natural Language Instruction**:
```
Please using Playwright tool to execute below test scenarios and summarize the testing report

TC01 - The landing page should contains specific text

Open website https://fitchecker.jbl.com
Check the landing page whether contains "JBL Fit Checker" text
Test case failed if it is not contains above text, Otherwise success.
```

**AI Assistant Execution Process**:

When you provide this instruction to your AI assistant (GitHub Copilot or Goose), the Playwright MCP will:

1. **Parse the Requirements**: Understand that we need to navigate to a URL and verify text content
2. **Browser Initialization**: Launch a browser instance (defaulting to Chromium)
3. **Navigation**: Navigate to the specified URL
4. **Content Verification**: Search for the specified text on the page
5. **Result Reporting**: Provide a comprehensive test report

### Test Case 2: Internationalization Testing

**Test Scenario**: Verify the language switching functionality works correctly.

**Natural Language Instruction**:
```
TC02 - The landing page able to switch to Chinese locale language.

Open AWS website https://fitchecker.jbl.com
The page should show the language as "EN"
Click the dropdown list to choose "ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá" language
Test case passed if the current page language is show as "ZH-CN", Otherwise failed.
```

**AI Assistant Execution Process**:

The Playwright MCP will handle this more complex scenario by:

1. **Initial State Verification**: Confirm the default language is "EN"
2. **Element Interaction**: Locate and interact with the language dropdown
3. **Option Selection**: Find and select the Chinese language option
4. **State Validation**: Verify the language change was successful
5. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Document all interactions and results
