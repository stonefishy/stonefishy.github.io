There is a sublime text theme I want to introduce to you guys. It's called `Cobalt2`, it not only colour scheme for editor window, but also it includes all sublime theme(e.g. sidebar, search, tabs, etc...). You can get it from github [cobalt2](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2).   

<!-- more -->

#### Installation
1. Open package control via pressing `Command + Shift + P` (mac os) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (windows) to open the command window, and then type `Install Package`.
2. Search for `Cobalt2` and hit `enter` key.
3. Once you installed finish, open `Preference` -> `Settings - User` and add the below lines:

```
"color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Cobalt2/cobalt2.tmTheme",
"theme": "Cobalt2.sublime-theme",
```
`color_scheme` defines how the code looks and `theme` defines how the sidebar, tabs, search, command palette work.

*Note: the sidebar icons only supports  the latest version of sublime text3.*

#### Screenshots
There have some screenshots of Cobalt2 theme from [cobalt2](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2).
