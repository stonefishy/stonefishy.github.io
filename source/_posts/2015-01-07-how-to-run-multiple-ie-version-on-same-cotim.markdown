As web developer, we usually need to face the challenge of making cross-browser compatible. Especially IE browser's multiple version. Because its quirks of rendering websites differently across its versions of `IE6`, `IE7`, `IE8` and possibly `IE9` and `IE10`.   

Most of us have only one version of IE browser on our computer, and the compatible mode of IE is not really specific version which you want to simulate.
