Python’s ecosystem thrives on its rich library of packages, but managing dependencies can sometimes feel sluggish, especially in large projects. Enter `UV`, a modern package manager and resolver designed to supercharge your workflow. Developed by `Astral` (the team behind the popular Ruff linter), `UV` promises blazing speed and seamless integration with existing Python tools. Let’s explore why UV might become your new go-to for dependency management.

## What is UV?
`UV` is a Rust-powered tool that combines a package installer (`pip`) and virtual environment manager (`venv`) into one ultra-fast solution. It aims to replace traditional tools like `pip`, `pipenv`, and `poetry` while staying fully compatible with their workflows. By leveraging Rust’s performance advantages, UV dramatically reduces installation and resolution times—often by `10-100x` compared to older tools.

## Why Use UV?
**Speed**: `UV` resolves and installs dependencies in seconds, even for complex projects.
**Simplicity**: It’s a drop-in replacement for `pip` and `venv`, requiring no workflow changes.
**Modern Features**: Supports `pyproject.toml`, `lock` files, and advanced dependency resolution.
**Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Getting Started with UV
### Installation
`UV` is distributed as a static binary, so installation is straightforward:

#### Install via pip (recommended) 

``` bash
pip install uv
```

#### Or use curl (Mac/Linux only)

``` bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Once the installation is complete, you can verify the installation by running:

``` bash
uv --version
```

Running below command to get the help message:

``` bash
uv --help
```

{% image /assets/images/python/uv-help.png, alt="UV help" %}

### Creating a Project
To create a new project with `UV`, run:

``` bash
uv init <project-name>
```

This will create a new project called <project-name> directory with a `pyproject.toml` file and a `uv.lock` file. The `pyproject.toml` file is where you can specify your project’s dependencies and other metadata. The `uv.lock` file is where `UV` stores the resolved dependencies and their versions.

Let's create a new project called `uv-sample`:

``` bash
uv init uv-sample
```

{% image /assets/images/python/uv-init1.png, alt="UV init project" %}

It also creates associated with the `git` for this project, `.python-version` file for managing Python version, and a sample `main.py` python file.

{% image /assets/images/python/uv-init2.png, alt="Project files generated by UV init" %}

The `pyproject.toml` file is where you can specify your project’s dependencies and other metadata. Since this project doesn't have any dependencies, so the `uv.lock` file is empty. Below is `uv-sample` `pyproject.toml` file:

``` toml
[project]
name = "uv-sample"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = []
```

### Manage Dependencies
Using `uv` to manage dependencies is as simple as adding them to the `dependencies` section of the `pyproject.toml` file. For example, to add `pandas` as a dependency, we can run:

``` bash
uv add pandas
```

{% image /assets/images/python/uv-add-dependency.png, alt="UV Add dependency" %}

From the screenshot, you can see before adding the dependency in python project. The `uv` also help us to create a virtual environment for our project. The package and dependencies installed in the virtual environment will be isolated from the system-wide packages.

The `uv.lock` file will be updated with the installed dependencies and their versions. And the `pyproject.toml` file will be updated with the new dependency.

`pyproject.toml` file after adding `pandas` as a dependency:

``` toml
[project]
name = "uv-sample"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [
    "pandas>=2.2.3",
]
```

`uv.lock` file is like a `package-lock.json` file for `npm` or `yarn`. It contains the resolved dependencies and their versions. We can see the installed dependencies and their versions in the `uv.lock` file. Please don't edit this file manually.

To see the dependencies tree, we can run `uv tree` command.

``` bash
uv tree
```

{% image /assets/images/python/uv-tree.png, alt="Dependencies via UV tree" %}

It lists all the dependencies and their dependencies recursively.

{% image /assets/images/python/uv-lock-file.png, alt="UV lock file" %}

You can also remove the dependency by running: `uv remove <dependency-name>`

``` bash
uv remove pandas
```

If your project is cloned. And you want to setup the development environment on your local. You can run `uv sync` to install the dependencies from the `uv.lock` file.

``` bash
uv sync
```

{% image /assets/images/python/uv-sync.png, alt="Install dependencies from UV sync" %}

See, it's very easy. It created a virtual environment for our project and installed the dependencies from the `uv.lock` file.

The `uv` has more features like using `uv` to install and select specific python verison, run the python code.

### Manage Python Version
Using the `uv` also can manage the python version for your project. Below is the snapshot to manage the python.

{% image /assets/images/python/uv-python.png, alt="UV python" %}

List all the available downloaded python.

``` bash
uv python list
```

{% image /assets/images/python/uv-python-list.png, alt="List of python versions" %}

You can download and install the specific python version. 

``` bash
uv python install <version>
```

Let's install the python version 3.14. See below screenshot.

``` bash
uv python install 3.14
```

{% image /assets/images/python/uv-python-install.png, alt="Install python version" %}

So using `uv` we can manage multiple python versions at same time. It's like `nvm` for node.js. For more using `uv` to manage the python version, you can type `uv python --help` to get the help message.

### Run Python Code
Before `uv`, we running the python code usuallly by using `python <python-file>`. In `uv`, we can run the python code using `uv run` command.

`main.py` example file.
``` python
def main():
    print("Hello from uv-sample!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Executing below command to run the python code.

``` bash
uv run main.py
```

## Summary
`UV` is a modern package manager and resolver designed to supercharge your workflow. It promises blazing speed and seamless integration with existing Python tools. It's a drop-in replacement for `pip` and `venv`, requiring no workflow changes. It works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
